## Project Specification

Shares Portfolio Application

A local trader has come to you with a portfolio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a Minimum Viable Product that uses the data to display her portfolio so that she can make better decisions.

MVP
A user should be able to:
 - view total current value
 - view individual and total performance trends.
 - retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
 - View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.
