## Brief:

MVP A user should be able to:
* View total current value
* View individual and total performance trends.
* Retrieve a list of share prices from an external API and allow the user to add shares to her portfolio.
* View a chart of the current values in her portfolio.

Possible Extensions:

* Be able to view current News relating to a specifc share.
* Setup the application for multiple users to use.
* Add a watched list for favourite shares.
* Allow a user to buy and sell shares.
